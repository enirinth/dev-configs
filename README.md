# dev-configs
My personal dev-enviroment configurations. Mostly for vim right now.     
A higher version of vim is needed. On OSX, it's not recommended to overwrite the built-in vim. The best way to get around this is to install MacVim, and make a symlink for vim.

# Nov 2016
Migrated all vim configs to neovim configs, most of them stayed the same 
Why neovim? Only because it's faster (especially when pressing O). Still playing with new features.
